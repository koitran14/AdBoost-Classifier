## 🧠 Overview

> Predict whether a product uses ad boosts based on features like price, ratings, and product text using 3 classic machine learning models.

* **Language**: Java
* **Library**: Weka
* **Dataset**: 1,573 product listings, 43 attributes
* **Target Feature**: `uses_ad_boosts`

---

## ⚙️ Features

* 🔧 Preprocessing: missing value imputation, outlier handling, duplicates removal
* ⚖️ SMOTE: for balancing the imbalanced class
* 🔤 Text Vectorization: StringToWordVector with TF-IDF & n-grams
* 🧪 Feature Selection: CfsSubsetEval, WrapperSubsetEval
* 🤖 Models: J48, Naive Bayes, Random Forest

## 🧪 Model Performance

| Model                | Accuracy   | F1-Score  |
| -------------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| 🌳 Random Forest     | **75.11%** | **0.735** |
| 📙 Naive Bayes       | 72.06%     | 0.721     |
| 🌲 J48 Decision Tree | 66.93%     | 0.618     |

> 🏆 **Random Forest** performed the best in overall accuracy and F1-score.
